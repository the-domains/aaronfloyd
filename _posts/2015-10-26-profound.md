Blogs have an inherent need to be profound. They drive our desire to show other people that we are worth their admiration and adulation. This however, is not quite a blog. So I am going to fight the need to profound all the time. As I learn to interact with this new platform and put content out there I hope that it will be helpful to you. If it isn't just let me know. Here's to many happy hours of writing and reading, sharing and laughing, and any other emotive response you might have to this!
