<p>Most of the men had been on this lake all their adult life. Working and playing, they had made their living on and from the water. Today should have been no different than any other day. They had picked the boat because they knew it could make it across the lake. The Master had looked at them and said, "Let's cross to the other side today." So they set out. It wasn't long before the gentle rocking of the waves and the soft wind set in and the Master went to sleep.</p><p>Suddenly, as can happen on this lake, a windstorm came blowing down. These men had been in storms on the water before. They had experienced the sudden wrath of the wind causing havoc with the small fishing boats. But this time it was different. This time they couldn't weather the storm. It raged in such a way as to make their resolve grow cold. The fear rose, overtaking, overwhelming. It became all consuming. Soon the water began to swamp the boat. The normal automatic processes that they would begin to protect the boat were not to be found. They were in danger. </p><p>Someone asked, "Where is the Master?" Others replied, "Is he still asleep?" Finally one of the men went to where he was and found him still asleep. In the midst of this storm. In the middle of the peril. He was still asleep. "Master, Master, we are perishing!" he cried. </p><p>The Master woke. He saw. He spoke. "Peace, be still." That voice! In an instant the wind remembered hearing him as it was born into existence, the water remembered him speaking it into joyful being. And in that moment, wind and wave heard the voice of the Master and were still. </p><p>But they were not the only ones that heard... there were 12 men in the boat that day also. And they heard the voice of the Master. They heard the command of peace, the charge to be still. And their hearts knew a peace that was not possible before. They stood, they sank to their knees. They were unable to understand what had happened. They marveled and said, "What sort of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him?"</p><p>But the Master looked at them. He loved them. He asked them a simple question, "Where is your faith?" He didn't condemn, didn't chastise. He simply asked, "Where is your faith?"</p><p>There is no single person who will walk through life that won't experience a storm they can't handle. It does not matter how strong you think you are, how well you handle yourself, or how skilled you are at taking care of business. At some point you will be caught in a storm that is too big for you.</p><p>It may be a storm you've lived through before. It may be a storm you've been living in for your whole life. </p><p>You may feel like your only option is to abandon ship. To jump out of the boat and give yourself over to the waves. To sink into the abyss and finally be free of the rage at the surface. Or, maybe worse, you've been told that you don't need to give up your storm. That it is what makes you "you." That you can live with this storm, carry this storm, or even celebrate this storm that is threatening to sink you, that has you scared for your life. </p><p>Jesus, the Master, would have different words for you. He does not say, "This situation is hopeless, better jump out and hope for the best." He does not say, "This is yours to carry forever. Let's hold it up for all to see." </p><p>The Master looks into your storm, into your eyes, and says, "Peace be still." </p><p>And when he does, the storm can stop. The wind quiets, the waves calm. And there is a peace that is beyond understanding that falls on your heart. </p><p>Don't jump out of the boat, don't continue living in the storm. Cry out to Jesus, "Master! I am perishing!" And let him calm the storm.</p><p>"Rembrandt Christ in the Storm on the Lake of Galilee" by Rembrandt - <a href="http://www.gardnermuseum.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gardnermuseum.org</a> : Home : Info : Pic.
